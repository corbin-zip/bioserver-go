# Open Source Outbreak Server: Go Edition

Are you looking to host your own Outbreak server? For the time being, you probably want to look at the original [Java implementation](https://github.com/corbin-zip/bioserver) instead of here.

This project is really meant as a way for me to get more familiar with Go and networking, and to get exposed to PS2 stuff. I made frequent use of an LLM which was both extremely helpful and time saving, while also leading to numerous bugs that took too long to fix.

Currently this project only implements File 1 but I hope to support File 2 in the future. I need to dig more deeply into the File 2 code and decide how I want to break the two game servers up. One server, multiple threads? One server, two databases? Two completely independent servers? etc.

I'll be trying to make use of GitHub issues to help keep track of stuff that I think needs addressing.
